1. install python and boto3 (developed and tested on 3.8 and 1.14.30)
2. in the command line, navigate to the "notags" folder.
3. run command "python tag_all.py" to run all other programs, or 
4. enter the profile name (setup in ~/.aws/config is required), and environment tag
5. you may be prompted to manually enter system codes if they are not automatically detected.

Notes:
1. Program can fail to tag buckets if they already have tags from CloudFormation -- an error message will be shown and the bucket will be skipped.
2. EBS volumes that are neither encrypted nor in use will be skipped
3. Unencrypted EBS snapshots will be skipped
4. VPC Endpoints should all be tagged the same, so instead of checking whether or not they are already tagged the program simply re-tags everything.
